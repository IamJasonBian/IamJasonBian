Hi, 

I'm an Industrial Engineer working on various optimization, sensoring, and analytics solutions within Industrial Engineering domains. Most of my projects are python (flask, django, pandas), R (dplyr), azure sql, html, and Javascript based.

Topics I'm interested in: 
  Stochastic Processing/Modeling 
  Linear Programming
  Regression
  Time-Series Forecasting
  Edge Processing
  Cloud Event-Hubs and telemetry Processing
  
 A few projects:
  Swingtech: Machine Learning 3d spatial classification and visualization via sensors
  Concrete Canoe: Optimized Hull/Hydrostatics canoe exteriors for concrete canoes via simulation
  Heijunka Schedular: VBA and python based manufacturing scheduling solution in production
  League of Legends Item Analysis: Api for querying live league of legends data
  Cloud Hydroponics: Cloud Based Sensoring Solution for flow telemetry 
  Optimized Van-Life: Full data science ready Van and Livable space. Combining Optimization and Van-Life concepts
  QR ERP: Cloud based ERP app for inventory management 
  
 Work Experience:
   DTE Energy: Six Sigma ERP for contractors to centralize problem solving and data entry
   Cummins: Factory floor level re-order point models for tooling. Dynamic inventory management for bottleneck machines
   Microsoft: Regression models for datacenter capacity optimization, azure warehouse inventory buffering based on historical usage volatility, Azure data-lake based data engineering and dev-ops workflows
